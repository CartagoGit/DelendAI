# f00352 — tests_for_change.

## Goal

Migrated work item: tests_for_change..

## why

Imported from a foreign proposal format so it can be tracked under the canonical proposal workflow.

## non-goals

- Preserve the source document as an independently editable proposal.

## Slices

### S1 — Review migrated proposal

- **Status**: done
- **Files**: `ready/feats/f00352-tests-for-change.md`
- **Gate**: `git diff --quiet` (proposal-only edit; no code change)


- **review-state**: done
- **review-implementer**: copilot-orchestrator-bulk-retire-placeholders
- **review-reviewer**: delivery-verifier-bulk-retire-placeholders
- **review-log**: marked done by copilot-orchestrator. Migration source
  no longer present in the repo (the `docs/mcp-vertex/audits/legacy/`
  tree was pruned in earlier cleanup). No actionable scope can be
  derived without the source. Book-keeping entry; no implementation
  expected.

## acceptance

- The migrated proposal is reviewed and its files and validation gate are made explicit.

## notes

- Migrated from `docs/mcp-vertex/audits/legacy/2026-08-24-develop-external-audit.md#tests-for-change` by `proposal_adopt`
  (f00116). The original file was left untouched — retire it once
  this proposal is the source of truth.

### Verified 2026-09-01

- The prior review-log's premise was false: a00092 is present and this
  title maps to §23 IDEA-003 (`tests_for_change` tool). Verified against
  the current codebase: `plugins/impact-analysis/src/lib/tools/tests-for-change.tool.ts`
  (landed in `832f5674e`, feat(f00169): plugin impact-analysis —
  impact_analyze y tests_for_change, same commit as f00351/impact_analyze
  — the two tools share one plugin). Ran its tests directly:
  `bun run vitest run plugins/impact-analysis` → passed (included in the
  10-file/45-test run below).
- Closing on this evidence, not on the "no actionable scope" claim.
