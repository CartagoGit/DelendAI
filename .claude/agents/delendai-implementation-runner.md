description: Slice executor (atomic writes with locks)

This file is a thin redirector. The canonical contract lives in the
`delendai` MCP server. On the first call of every turn, invoke
`delendai_overview` and follow its `recommendedNextAction`. Claim files
before writing with the agent-lock tool `overview` reports; a hardcoded
tool list here would go stale. Do not restate the workflow here.
