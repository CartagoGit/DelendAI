/**
 * search-engine.types.ts — Solid-SRP extraction (types only).
 *
 * `search-engine.service.ts` previously held 4+ interfaces inline:
 * the public `ISearchHit`, `ISearchResult`, `ISearchOptions`, the
 * internal `IRgJsonMatchLine`, `IRgJsonContextLine`, the error
 * `InvalidSearchPatternError`, plus the helpers `globToRegExp` and
 * the `.gitignore` parsers. Moving the public surface here lets
 * the `search-engine.backends.ts` (Strategy implementations) depend
 * on the same types without importing the dispatcher.
 *
 * Solid-ISP: `ISearchBackend` is the narrowest contract a Strategy
 * needs to satisfy. Backends know nothing about gitignore parsing,
 * rg JSON Lines, or the dispatcher's fallback tree.
